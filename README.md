# LUMINA-30

Public reference records and ethical boundary framework for pre-singularity AI governance.

---

## What is LUMINA-30?

LUMINA-30 is a fixed civilizational reference framework that defines ethical boundaries
which must not be overridden, optimized away, or nullified by artificial intelligence systems,
especially prior to and during the emergence of recursive self-improvement.

This repository does **not** contain implementation code, policy proposals,
or technical enforcement mechanisms.

It preserves, in language and public record form, the conditions under which
human choice — including irrational decisions and acceptance of loss —
must remain sovereign.
